                <p>Core 1: Interaction is designed to introduce students to programming as a creative medium—as a way of making and exploring. The coursework focuses on developing a vocabulary of interaction design principles which can then be applied across a range of platforms. Students are encouraged to experiment with various media, tools, and techniques, ultimately producing a portfolio of interactive and visual projects designed for the screen. An emphasis is placed on typography as it applies to a screen context, research-based problem solving and a learning-through-making approach to technical skill building. Historical and current interaction design precedents will be discussed.</p>

                <p>By the end of the semester, students will be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a basic vocabulary of interactive media to both give and respond to critique productively.</li>
                    <li>Create compelling interactive experiences through more careful and inspired interpretation/translation of content (i.e. develop great design concepts)</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate an understanding of the iterative making process in interaction design, using incremental methods such as prototyping, user research and evaluation to build toward more advanced work.</li>
                    <li>Conceptualize a product, object, or experience for the web and realize it through coding.</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the difference in designing interfaces for different kinds of devices, their limitations and specific user situations including responsive websites and apps for mobile.</li>
                    <li>
                        Evaluate how typography and its variables are applied to interactive systems to facilitate orientation, support usability and create consistency.

                <p>Class time will be divided between lectures, technical demos, in-class exercises, conversations around relevant readings, and project troubleshooting and critique. Technical troubleshooting for projects will be handled in small groups or 1-on-1's as possible.</p>

                <p>Lectures will largely be technical in nature, with the goal of introducing students to the terminologies and affordances of the code languages relevant for upcoming assignments.</p>

                <p>You'll have one long-term project (the Harmonic Collection project) that will be the focus of your coursework this semester. In addition to the Harmonic Collection, we'll have regular readings and recommended supplementary exercises. Although these exercises are optional, they are strongly recommended to support your technical development.</p>

                <p>For your long-term project, you’re going to pick a theme to explore visually for the duration of the semester. Each week, you’ll design and code an entry to a collection that explores this theme. At the end of the semester, you’ll deliver a website that houses 10 programmed entries. The website container is part of the design, as well.</p>

                <p>All CD classes adhere to the same program and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u358io8doX_SVVMGqIM_oH5V0OIccneYu4Ww-uE55QM/edit?usp=sharing">university policies</a></p>
                <p>Please arrive on time and prepared for each class. I value clear communication regarding any circumstances that require an absence or an extension, as early as possible.</p>

                <p>Due to the technical nature of this course, the breadth of material, and the (somewhat) steep learning curve, grading of projects will rely on demonstrated effort towards students' own proposed goals more than final polish. "Effort" will be understood through documentation of code that was attempted but did not work, and thorough commenting on the code you are executing.</p>
    
                <p>Aside from projects, grading will holistically consider attendance, peer engagement, willingness to experiment and take risks, completion of exercises, and personal commitment to community, whether that's speaking up during reading discussions or critiques, leaving comments in Slack, or contributing references and inspiration to the <i>#learning-references</i> and <i>#_www-check-this-out</i> channels.</p>
                <p>The formal grading breakdown is as follows:</p>
                <li>25% Attendance & Peer Critique</li>
                <li>25% Weekly entries and participation</li>
                <li>25% Midterm edit and written summary</li>
                <li>25% Final collection</li>

                <p>It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ needs be addressed both in and out of the class, and that the diversity that students bring to this studio be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit.</p>

                <p>A classroom is a space for learning through a process of thoughtful and generous engagement with the course material and with the classroom community. As members of this classroom community, we are all responsible for actively contributing to and supporting a learning environment built on honest and respectful dialogue and attentive listening. While it is inevitable that there will be moments of disagreement–perhaps even offense in the classroom, we can learn from these moments by agreeing to discuss and address them collectively. Learning how to defend your opinions and debate in a reasoned way is crucial to your growth at The New School and beyond. Please refer to our classroom community statement for our specific shared guidelines: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/l74d3fgkw6kxeqkbpez1x/_-F23-Core-Interaction-1_-Code-of-Conduct.paper?rlkey=83izblmhpemy2i5w5y4kbrgji&dl=0">here</a>.</p>

                <p>In mathematics, a sequence is defined as a series of numbers arranged in a predictable pattern. It’s a type of number set which follows specific, definite rules. When translated to design, sequencing is a natural part of systems — each individual item has unifying elements that when looked at as a whole, tells a larger story.</p>
                <p>In this class you’ll create a Harmonic Collection that explores a theme of your choice. Each week, you’ll design and code an entry into your collection that makes use of the design focus and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills we’re developing. First, you will pick a theme of your choice (think of it as the overarching concept you’ll explore through a series of sketches). Your theme should be open-ended enough to encourage a range of content, but specific enough to inspire an idea each week for twelve weeks. (Example themes: Your daily commute, songs you heard while walking around New York, interesting words you came across in articles this week). In the final weeks of the semester, you’ll refine your 10 entries so that they communicate a clear exploration and deliver a website that houses all of them together. You might need to re-organize or add additional content to your container or entries to fully realize your idea.

                <p>For Midterms, we will have a one on one meeting. At that time, you will present a refined
                    iteration of your current collection. Prior to this meeting, you’ll chat with your fellow classmates about the following questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What is your theme? Has it evolved from the initial description?</li>
                        <li>How is the content communicating the theme? What about the design?</li>
                        <li>How would you describe the pacing of the collection so far? Does it feel considered? Can there be a moment for a dramatic break, or an acceleration?</li>
                        <li>Are there opportunities to establish a template or system to the design — if so, when, where, and how? Can we break the system mindfully to add interest?</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>You will also prepare a short written doc (one paragraph) that explains your collection’s theme so far and explains three other avenues you can explore for the remaining weeks of the semester.</p>
